I am a Ph.D. student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Economics Department, specializing in health, public finance, and labor economics. My current research focuses on healthcare labor markets, health technology product markets, and uncompensated hospital care. Prior to MIT, I received a BA in Economics from Wellesley College and worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
